# Latent Space Reasoning

**Program (opened 2026-08-27): the native mathematics of latent spaces.**
Embedding and latent spaces are not number systems. This program builds their
mathematics from axioms upward — what a latent space is, which relations and
operations are meaningful — and derives definitions and propositions from
there, Euclid-style, rather than porting ℝⁿ mathematics onto embedding vectors.
Classical goals carry over (measure closeness, update on evidence, compose,
infer, prove); the native constructs may look nothing like their classical
counterparts.

Status 2026-08-29: Round 36 v1 and 36b remain governed by audits #23 and #24; Round 36c remains a failed moving-target positive control under audit #25. Round 36d, the one frozen-chart head-only calibration, is complete: a fresh optimizer-fitted head on an assigned behavior-derived chart achieved exact behavior and eight individual gate predicates, but the joint status is `FAIL — INTERCHANGEABILITY` (`1/5` exact seeds). Audit #26 limits this to a privileged individual-gate reachability result, not quotient discovery or a learned certificate. No complete learned artifact has passed the exact reducer. Round 36 calibration is closed; the constructive program moves to Round 37's presentation-duplicated 32-to-16 quotient world.

## Prior program and correction (closed 2026-08-27)

The previous program — LLM embedding perturbation, diffusion latent repair,
multi-latent aggregation — is archived unmodified under [`legacy/`](legacy/).
Its nested-arithmetic perturbation claims ("perturbation unlocks capabilities
that scaling cannot", beats temperature, better cost-per-capability) were
**withdrawn** after independent controls by Igor Rivin (PRs #4, #5) showed the
benchmark measured termination under a token cap, not arithmetic. Record:
[legacy/docs/CORRECTION_NESTED_ARITHMETIC_2026_08.md](legacy/docs/CORRECTION_NESTED_ARITHMETIC_2026_08.md).
Standing results from that program are summarized in
[legacy/README.md](legacy/README.md). One finding carries forward: greedy
decoding determinism is hardware-dependent, so any diversity claim must report
the stack's numerical noise floor.

## Rules for claims

A claim is exploratory until it has a stated axiom base or predeclared task
slice, raw artifacts, a falsifier, and a control run for the cheapest
alternative explanation. Empirical checks on real embedding spaces report the
stack's determinism and noise floor.
