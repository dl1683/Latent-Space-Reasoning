# Latent Space Reasoning

**Program (opened 2026-08-27): the native mathematics of latent spaces.**
Embedding and latent spaces are not number systems. This program builds their
mathematics from axioms upward — what a latent space is, which relations and
operations are meaningful — and derives definitions and propositions from
there, Euclid-style, rather than porting ℝⁿ mathematics onto embedding vectors.
Classical goals carry over (measure closeness, update on evidence, compose,
infer, prove); the native constructs may look nothing like their classical
counterparts.

Status 2026-08-29: no native latent mathematics has been demonstrated. `coordinate_v3` establishes only a narrow late lexical-control effect; `state_bus_v1r1` is closed as a fixed-construction FAIL with pair-specific lexical/semantic steering; and `interchange_v2` found that replacing only the block-12 residual at the final generic anchor moved the calibration-centred cat/dog probe signature by a median 0.0087 class separations and changed none of 24 probe decisions. This closes that fixed single-anchor construction, not frozen residual structure, class information at the anchor, or distributed alternatives. The program now moves from interchangeability to an intervention-based reachability/control-cost artifact.

## Prior program and correction (closed 2026-08-27)

The previous program — LLM embedding perturbation, diffusion latent repair,
multi-latent aggregation — is archived unmodified under [`legacy/`](legacy/).
Its nested-arithmetic perturbation claims ("perturbation unlocks capabilities
that scaling cannot", beats temperature, better cost-per-capability) were
**withdrawn** after independent controls by Igor Rivin (PRs #4, #5) showed the
benchmark measured termination under a token cap, not arithmetic. Record:
[legacy/docs/CORRECTION_NESTED_ARITHMETIC_2026_08.md](legacy/docs/CORRECTION_NESTED_ARITHMETIC_2026_08.md).
Standing results from that program are summarized in
[legacy/README.md](legacy/README.md). One finding carries forward: greedy
decoding determinism is hardware-dependent, so any diversity claim must report
the stack's numerical noise floor.

## Rules for claims

A claim is exploratory until it has a stated axiom base or predeclared task
slice, raw artifacts, a falsifier, and a control run for the cheapest
alternative explanation. Empirical checks on real embedding spaces report the
stack's determinism and noise floor.
