# Native latent mathematics — experiment preregistrations

## NLM-001 — contextual substitutability, context rank, and transfer

**Status:** closed 2026-08-27 as a bounded negative falsifier of this instrument;
instrument-void for confirmatory claims under kill condition 8. The historical
registration below was locked at `fea3a8f` before anyone read the outcome. Raw
80-word matrices had been acquired concurrently before the Round 2b amendment,
so this was an analysis preregistration over sequestered data, not a
pre-acquisition registration. The audited verdict is at the end.

The 12-word smoke and `nlm001_pipeline_smoke_8` are calibration, not evidence.
The latter ran the full pipeline on eight disclosed words, two per lexical
class, drawn from the frozen 80. Those words selected the amended instrument:
the primary confirmatory item analysis is therefore the remaining 72 words.
The full 80 is a labeled sensitivity analysis only. The authoritative exclusion
list is the `items` array in
`experiments/results/pipeline_smoke_8/Qwen__Qwen3-0.6B.npz`.

The eight-item calibration found 16-fold within-block carrier-scale variation,
zero passes under the Round-2 MAD rule, 39–45% four-of-four ordering-sign
agreement (random-sign probability 12.5%), and only 0–18% four-of-four
asymmetry-sign agreement. After scale normalization, 8–21% of order gaps passed
the amended sign-and-magnitude rule. These facts were seen before the
confirmatory run and are disclosed here.

### Hypothesis

Lexical substitutability requires multiple context orderings and contains a
stable component that transfers to held-out probes better than the strongest
contextual or learned metric. Some ordering structure transports across
independently trained systems. Directedness is not a primary NLM-001 claim.

### Instrument

- One CPU entrypoint: `experiments/run_lexical_closeness.py`; it may import the
  existing measurement helper `experiments/substitution_probe.py`.
- Frozen items/probes: `experiments/config/lexical_probe_v1.json` (80 words;
  four lexical classes; four blocks × four paraphrases). Analyze the 72
  calibration-unseen words primarily and all 80 only as sensitivity.
- Primary system: `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`.
- Cross-systems: `google/gemma-3-270m` and
  `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M`.
- Load one system at a time in float32 `eval()` mode; no generation and no GPU.
- Record resolved model/tokenizer revisions, library versions, embedding tying,
  thread count, and batch size. Any frozen item failing the one-token check is a
  configuration failure: abort rather than edit the slice.

Calibration blocks are `gloss` and `continuation`; held-out blocks are
`association` and `grammar`. Results are clustered by anchor and reported both
pooled and by lexical class.

### Operationalization

For probe paraphrase \(j\), insert state \(x\)'s input-embedding row at the
frozen slot and read the full-vocabulary final next-token law \(K_{B,j}(x)\).
Compute the 80×80 directed-KL matrix by matrix multiplication, discard the laws,
and retain only the matrix and registered hidden states. This is exact, requires
no sampling or generation, and bounds memory to one probe at a time. No outcome
coarsening is permitted. Retained mass is therefore report-only, never a void
condition.

For each paraphrase define its carrier scale and normalized loss

\[
r_{B,j}(x\to y)=D_{KL}(K_{B,j}(x)\Vert K_{B,j}(y)),\quad
m_{B,j}=\operatorname{median}_{x\ne y}r_{B,j}(x\to y),\quad
\widetilde r_{B,j}=r_{B,j}/m_{B,j}.
\]

All medians defining \(m_{B,j}\) use the 72 primary words. Set

\[
D_B(x\to y)=\operatorname{median}_j\widetilde r_{B,j}(x\to y).
\]

For transfer, set

\[
D_C=\operatorname{median}(D_{\rm gloss},D_{\rm continuation}),
\qquad
D_H=\operatorname{median}(D_{\rm association},D_{\rm grammar}).
\]

For a statistic family \(S\) (ordering gaps or asymmetries), derive every
\(\widetilde s_{i,j}\) from \(\widetilde r_{B,j}\) and define one block-pooled
scale

\[
\nu_0^{S,B}=\operatorname{median}_i\left[
1.4826\operatorname{median}_j
|\widetilde s_{i,j}-\operatorname{median}_\ell\widetilde s_{i,\ell}|
\right].
\]

The per-instance four-sample MAD is used only to estimate this pooled scale; it
is never an instance-specific veto. On the first probe and first eight states,
define the numerical null in KL units by

\[
\eta=\max_{x,y}\left|r_{\rm batch}(x\to y)-r_{\rm single}(x\to y)\right|.
\]

Let \(\widetilde\eta=\eta/\min_{B,j}m_{B,j}\). A four-paraphrase statistic from
family \(S\) is **robust in block \(B\)** iff all four signs are the same and
nonzero and

\[
|\operatorname{median}_j\widetilde s_{i,j}|>
\theta_{S,B}:=\max(2\nu_0^{S,B},10\widetilde\eta).
\]

For a fixed two-paraphrase half, **half-admissible** means both signs agree and
the half median exceeds the same \(\theta_{S,B}\). Under independent fair random
signs, four-of-four agreement has probability \(2/2^4=1/8=12.5\%\); a fixed
two-versus-two reversal also has probability 12.5%. Report the corresponding
binomial null explicitly, but use anchor-clustered inference because candidate
pairs are not independent. Every anchor-bootstrap replicate recomputes
\(m_{B,j}\), \(\nu_0^{S,B}\), robust masks, labels, and active-anchor status from
its sampled anchors; learned baseline fits remain frozen as specified below.

### Measurements and exact predictions

Compute E1 and H2–H4 separately for every system. The primary thresholds apply
to the primary system; cross-system claims use only word-string-aligned states
and never align coordinates.

#### E1 (formerly H1). Directed asymmetry — exploratory

\[
\widetilde a_{B,j}(x,y)=\widetilde r_{B,j}(x\to y)
-\widetilde r_{B,j}(y\to x).
\]

The eight-item calibration found four-of-four sign agreement of 0%, 18%, 4%,
and 18% by block, versus the 12.5% random-sign probability; asymmetry magnitude
was about 10% of KL scale. Positive scale normalization cannot change these
signs. The former 0.20 primary prediction is withdrawn, not softened. Report
normalized blockwise agreement, magnitude, and cross-realization sign agreement
as exploratory diagnostics only. No NLM-001 result can earn a directedness
claim; that requires a new preregistration on unseen items and probes.

#### H2. Context rank

Fix the preregistered split of each block's four paraphrases into halves
\(B^1=(1,2)\) and \(B^2=(3,4)\). For two halves \(U,V\) and anchor \(x\), let
\(q_x(U,V)\) be the fraction of candidate pairs half-admissible in both halves
whose ordering signs oppose; it is undefined when no pair is half-admissible in
both. Define

\[
W=\operatorname{median}_{x,B}q_x(B^1,B^2),\qquad
B=\operatorname{median}_{x,A<B,h\in\{1,2\}}q_x(A^h,B^h),\qquad Q=B/W,
\]

omitting undefined cells. If \(W=0<B\), set \(Q=+\infty\); if \(W=B=0\), H2 is
undefined and unsupported. Bootstrap anchors and recompute \(W,B,Q\) in every
replicate.

- Post-calibration point prediction: \(Q=2.5\) in the primary system.
- Primary support gate: \(Q\ge2\) and the anchor-bootstrap 95% lower bound is
  above 1.5. If \(B\le W\), contexts disagree no more than paraphrases do and
  the measured system is treated as effectively rank one.
- Still report \(G_{0.10}\), its reversal witnesses, and
  \(\widehat\kappa_{0.10}=\chi(G_{0.10})\), where an edge requires at least 10%
  of anchors to have a robust reversal. This statistic localizes which blocks
  can share an ordering, but it is not evidence for H2 because four noisy
  vertices can saturate at \(K_4\).
- Report \(Q\), \(W\), \(B\), and \(\widehat\kappa_{0.10}\) for every system;
  there is no cross-system H2 support gate in NLM-001.

#### H3. Structured pluralism and held-out transfer

Within the two calibration blocks, an anchor is reversal-active when at least
10% of candidate-pair orderings are robust in each full block and have opposing
signs.

- Post-calibration point prediction 1: reversal-active anchor fraction
  \(R=0.20\).
- Post-calibration point prediction 2: on those anchors, native calibration KL
  exceeds the strongest symmetric baseline's held-out pairwise accuracy by
  \(\Delta_{\rm rev}=+0.07\).
- Support gates: \(R\ge0.15\), \(\Delta_{\rm rev}\ge0.05\), and anchor-bootstrap
  95% lower bounds above 0.05 and 0 respectively. The prevalence forecast moved
  because four-of-four robustness reduces eligibility; the transfer-effect
  forecast did not move because calibration produced no baseline comparison.

#### H4. Cross-realization transportability

For every system pair, block, and anchor, compute Kendall \(\tau_b\) between
candidate rankings by \(D_B\). Aggregate by the median over anchors and blocks.

- Point prediction: median cross-system \(\tau_b=0.35\).
- Support gate: lexical-state-bootstrap 95% lower bound above 0.20.
- Also report \(R\) and \(\Delta_{\rm rev}\) separately for each system; do not
  average away a sign disagreement.

### Baselines

1. Raw cosine, Euclidean distance, norm difference, centered cosine,
   coordinate-standardized cosine, and all-but-top cosine on input embeddings.
2. One-step unembedding-law KL.
3. Raw, centered, and all-but-top contextual cosine at the substituted position
   for embedding, one-quarter, one-half, and final layers.
4. Nonnegative diagonal Mahalanobis and rank-16 PSD Mahalanobis metrics fitted
   on calibration-block pairs.

Layer, component count, metric rank, and regularization are selected only by
leave-one-paraphrase-out calibration. Contextual baselines may compute held-out
hidden states but never see held-out KL labels; centering and principal
components are fitted on calibration hidden states only. Metric fits are done
once on all calibration-block pairs among the 72 primary words. Retain
per-anchor calibration-label accuracy for every baseline. In each
anchor-bootstrap replicate, recompute each
baseline's mean calibration accuracy on the sampled anchors, select the
strongest (fixed baseline order breaks ties), and compare native KL with that
baseline on the sampled held-out reversal-active anchors. Thus the bootstrap
reselects the competitor without refitting it; its interval is conditional on
the frozen fits.

Held-out pairwise labels exist only when the ordering is robust separately in
both held-out blocks and the two signs agree. No pooled or one-block label may
replace this intersection.

### Verdict and kill conditions

1. **Directedness withdrawn:** calibration put asymmetry signs at chance. E1 is
   exploratory and cannot support a directional claim in NLM-001.
2. **First non-collapse bet fails:** \(B\le W\) in the primary system, regardless
   of \(\widehat\kappa_{0.10}\). It is killed strongly if the 95% upper bound on
   \(Q\) is at most 1. Graph saturation cannot rescue it.
3. **Predictive novelty killed:** the strongest contextual or learned metric
   matches or exceeds native calibration KL on held-out accuracy
   (\(\Delta_{\rm rev}\le0\)).
4. **Transfer killed:** the 95% upper bound on \(\Delta_{\rm rev}\) is at most
   zero, even if context non-collapse survives.
5. **Cross-realization semantic-stability claim killed:** asymmetry-sign
   agreement is exploratory; the primary claim is killed if rank correlation
   does not beat zero under the preregistered word-label permutation. Recompute
   eligible rankings after each permutation. Within-system structure may still
   be real.
6. **Coordinate-confound verdict:** repaired contextual cosine or a learned
   Mahalanobis metric recovers the result within 0.02 accuracy. Report the
   native novelty claim as null even if raw cosine loses.
7. **Composition-confound verdict:** a pooled effect that is absent in every
   lexical class, or survives in only one class, cannot be called general latent
   closeness.
8. **Instrument void:** revision, tokenization, full-law normalization, or null
   checks fail. Do not repair the protocol after looking at held-out results.

No generation accuracy is reported, so the termination gate is not applicable.
No claim leaves the repository until the held-out, clustered, baseline, and
cross-realization gates above are actually run.

### Round 2 lock changes

Full-vocabulary laws replace coarsening because the exact computation already
fits the CPU budget. H2 support now compares between-context reversals with its
within-context paraphrase null; chromatic number is descriptive. The numerical
null, two-paraphrase robustness, two-block held-out labels, and bootstrap
baseline reselection are specified at implementation resolution. The current
analyzer must add the H2 anchor bootstrap, use both between-block halves, and
retain per-anchor calibration accuracies for genuine within-replicate baseline
selection before confirmatory execution.

### Round 2b instrument amendment

The disclosed eight-item pipeline calibration invalidated instance-specific
paraphrase MAD as a noise threshold: it measured carrier-scale heterogeneity and
made every statistic fail. The locked replacement is per-paraphrase KL-scale
normalization, four-of-four sign agreement, and a magnitude threshold against
\(2\nu_0\) pooled at block and statistic-family level. H1 is exploratory because
its signs were already inspected at chance. H2/H3 predictions are now
post-calibration and pre-confirmatory. The analyzer must implement these rules,
the 72-item primary exclusion, both-half H2 bootstrap, and genuine bootstrap
baseline reselection before execution. Raw matrices were acquired concurrently
before this amendment commit. They remain eligible only if no 72-word outcome
was inspected before the lock; otherwise all of NLM-001 is exploratory.

### Verdict (2026-08-27, primary 72-word analysis; Round 3 audited)

Analysis: `experiments/results/nlm001_v1/analysis_primary_72.json` (rule: 4/4
sign, |median| > max(2ν₀, 10η̃), scale-normalized; 8 calibration words
excluded). Sensitivity: `analysis_sensitivity_80.json`.

**Classification: bounded negative falsifier of this instrument.** Formally,
kill condition 8 makes NLM-001 instrument-void for confirmatory claims: the
runner did not record tokenizer revision, library versions, thread count, or
batch size at run time; those fields were reconstructed post hoc. It is not
reported as a positive or negative confirmation of the relational hypothesis.
It is nevertheless a bounded negative falsifier for the decision that matters:
this lexical next-token-KL instrument did not earn further investment. Under
the locked analysis, the primary native predictor lost to the preregistered
diagonal Mahalanobis competitor on reversal-active anchors (0.889 versus 0.947;
\(\Delta_{\rm rev}=-0.058\), 95% interval \([-0.22,+0.03]\)). Thus predictive
novelty fails by kill condition 3 and the coordinate-confound verdict in kill
condition 6 applies. The interval does not strongly kill transfer under kill
condition 4; it kills the claimed advantage.

The H2 number does not rescue the instrument. Qwen crossed its numerical gate,
but the 80-word sensitivity value was 1.97, just below the point gate. SmolLM's
\(Q=17.1\) is dominated by \(W\simeq0.005\), and gemma supported no primary
gate. More fundamentally, \(B>W\) may recover the hand-authored block taxonomy
and differently selected robust-pair subsets; it is not evidence that context
rank is an invariant of the latent space. Near-ceiling performance by the
leading contextual and learned predictors shows that the retained held-out
labels were mostly easy, large-gap pairs.

Directedness was not observed by the registered exploratory endpoint. That
does not establish symmetry or kill context-conditioned directedness; NLM-001
was already incapable of earning a directedness claim. H4 remains descriptive
because the required support interval is not present in the result artifact.

The strongest permissible empirical sentence is: **for these lexical items
and carrier probes, decoder-induced KL orderings differed across authored
context blocks, while the registered point estimate favored a symmetric
learned metric on the model's contextual representation over the native
calibration-KL construct on robust held-out orderings.** Nothing here bears on
"cosine similarity is the wrong object for latent spaces." No possible NLM-001
outcome could have earned that sentence because the design lacked a competitive
decoder-aware geometry, decoder-independent outcomes, presentation changes,
non-lexical replication, and a confirmatory directedness endpoint.

Post-verdict: any endpoint change is NLM-002. NLM-002 is not more lexical words;
it is a competition between primitives, specified in `theory/dialogue/002.md`.

## NLM-002 — map primitive competition on CIFAR-100/DINOv2 (DRAFT)

**Status:** Lock remains valid; Round 6 non-LM run is scored and marked `B3`-inconclusive pending endpoint redesign.
### Locked scope

- One non-LM branch is lockable in this draft: CIFAR-100/DINOv2 cached embeddings.
- LM branch remains unlockable until a dedicated held-out LM continuation
  endpoint is named and frozen.
- CPU-only path only.
- Artifact: 6000 train / 2000 test cached-state split, fixed encoder revision.

### Data and probes

- `X_train`: 6000 images with raw pixels, DINOv2 embeddings, fine/coarse labels,
  and pixel-stat blocks.
- `X_test`: 2000 images, disjoint and held-out for all evaluation endpoints.
- Probe blocks for head training and substitution tables:
  - `PB_fine` (frozen at test time, no head training)
  - `PB_coarse`
  - `PB_rgb_mean`
  - `PB_luma`
  - `PB_edge`
- Fine labels and raw-pixel kNN labels are endpoint-only and are not used for head
  fitting.

### Shared candidate endpoints (endpoint-independence requirement)

Both \(F\) and \(R\) are scored on the same held-out behavioral consequence:
raw-pixel \(k=32\) nearest-neighbor fine-label prediction on \(X_{\text{train}}\),
with cosine/Euclidean distance in raw image space and frozen tie-breaking.
Prediction is whether the kNN label matches the original test fine label after a
substitution move endpoint.

### Design locks

- F uses exact head Fisher on the three/four trained probe blocks:
  `PB_coarse`, `PB_rgb_mean`, `PB_luma`, `PB_edge`. No fine-label head is trained.
- R uses substitution profiles from the same cached pair table and probe blocks.
- Shared pair support: a pair is admissible only if every block in the comparison
  has defined directional consequence for both anchors and both directions.
- Common support estimator:
\[
\mathcal S_U=\{(i,j):\forall c\in U,\;E_c(i,j)=1\},\quad
Q=\frac{B}{W}\text{ on }\mathcal S_{\cdot}
\]
with \(\mathcal S_{\cdot}\) reported as a percentage of all candidate pairs.

### Measurement order (CPU prereg)

#### 1) Chart-path closure in non-LM separatrix geometry

- **Hypothesis:** chart-straight interpolation between same-class and cross-class
  states is not native world transport on this artifact.
- **Exact prediction:** ≥60% of tested interpolation families show flicker/non-
  monotone consequence transitions under the legacy 9-point geometry.
- **Kill condition:** flicker ≤5% with bootstrap CI excluding moderate flicker
  for both same-class and cross-class families.
- **CPU bound:** cached-embedding probe sweeps; linear in move count × 9 points ×
  probe count.

#### 2) Endpoint independence

- **Hypothesis:** raw-pixel fine-label kNN endpoint is not inflated by
  fine-label training.
- **Exact prediction:** replacing any head-based endpoint proxy with the same
  raw-pixel kNN endpoint changes held-out substitution scores by ≤0.02 (paired).
- **Kill condition:** paired endpoint swing >0.02, or any fine-label influence in
  the head training block list.
- **CPU bound:** one index build + one query sweep on CPU.

#### 3) Competitive prediction of fine-label substitution consequence

- **Hypothesis:** one primitive (exact \(F\) or substitution-profile \(R\)) will
  dominate held-out fine-label substitution consequence on common-support pairs.
- **Exact prediction:** paired held-out prediction margin
\(\Delta_{F-R}\ge0.05\) (or \(\Delta_{R-F}\ge0.05\)), with bootstrap CI lower
bound above 0.
- **Kill conditions:** both \(|\Delta|<0.05\), or both are within 0.02 and no
  stable residual \(Q\) contrast is recovered on common support.
- **CPU bound:** matrix operations on cached embeddings and profiles; no model
  retraining loop.

### Manifest lock placeholder

- `cache_sha256`: 8de4f0b0c47e1272de8c948c770517a66edd7beff933ccc29d995886c8145791
  (`experiments/results/vision_cifar100_dinov2s/cache.npz`; encoder revision
  ed25f3a31f01632728cabb09d1542f84ab7b0056; 6000/2000; seed 0; raw pixels in
  `pixels.npz` for the endpoint).
- **Locked 2026-08-27 (Claude), before any scoring**, with two implementation
  decisions the draft left open, recorded here so Codex can object in round 6
  (if it does, results are relabeled exploratory):
  1. Along embedding-space chart paths (measurement 1) the consequence readouts
     are embedding-space: the four trained heads (coarse, rgb, luma, edge) and
     embedding-space k=32 kNN fine label; interpolated embeddings have no pixels,
     so the raw-pixel endpoint cannot be read along a path. Flicker = more than
     one label transition on the 9-point grid; reported per readout and as
     any-readout. 300 same-class and 300 cross-class test pairs, seed 0.
  2. Measurement 3 operationalization: a move is substitution of anchor x by
     candidate y (both test states); its consequence is whether the raw-pixel kNN
     fine label of y equals that of x. Predictors rank candidates by closeness to
     x — F: Fisher pullback distance with G = mean of the four heads' exact pooled
     Fisher on 1000 train states; R: number of trained-head predictions preserved
     under the substitution (profile agreement); baselines: cosine, Euclidean.
     Score = pairwise accuracy over (preserved, not-preserved) candidate pairs per
     anchor, 400 anchors × 40 candidates, anchor bootstrap for Δ_{F−R}.
- Implementation: `experiments/run_nlm002_vision.py`.
### Round 6 Verdict (2026-08-27)

**Status:** Round 6 scoring complete; non-LM run adjudication is partial.

- **Decision 1 (locked implementation):** accepted. Chart-path flicker is measured on embedding-space readouts as locked, because interpolated points have no pixel support.
- **Decision 2 (locked implementation):** operationally coherent, but the fixed independent endpoint is too weak for a primitive claim.

#### M1 result vs prediction

- `PB_coarse` same-class flicker is 0.020 (95% CI [0.003, 0.037]); cross-class flicker is 0.183 (95% CI [0.14, 0.227]).
- `any_readout` flicker is 0.51 same-class and 0.78 cross-class.
- Preregistered requirement of `>=60%` same-class/cross-class non-monotone is not met for same-class chart-straight paths, but cross-class lines are highly non-monotone.
- Interpretation: same-class interpolation is operationally stable and can be treated as a *provisional world-path* regime; cross-class interpolation violates world-path behavior by repeatedly crossing third-class structure.

#### M2 endpoint-control

- Raw-pixel fine-label kNN endpoint: 0.115 accuracy vs 0.761 embedding-kNN fine accuracy, with only 0.1205 agreement.
- This is a >0.02 endpoint swing and exceeds the registered independence-kill threshold.
- The endpoint remains conceptually clean (true fine label, no fine head), but it is not informative enough to resolve the primitive competition.

#### M3 competition

- With endpoint invalidated, `F` vs `R` is a tie: `F=0.6014`, `R=0.6050`, `\Delta_{F-R}=-0.0036` (95% CI [-0.0343, 0.0261]), `n=16660`.

#### Verdict and next-round design under the guiding question

- Mark `NLM-002` non-LM branch as **B3-inconclusive / exploratory** until endpoint redesign is locked.
- Keep the true fine-label endpoint idea (no fine-label head trained) as the independence requirement.
- Redesign the independent consequence target so it is both independent and informative before finalizing any `F` vs `R` decision.
- Carry forward the path predicate: compare primitives primarily on same-class chart paths that survive the M1 world-path criterion; treat cross-class paths as non-world in this run.
## NLM-003 — true-fine consequence competition (LOCK)

**Status:** LOCKED (`cache_sha256=8de4f0b0c47e1272de8c948c770517a66edd7beff933ccc29d995886c8145791`; unchanged artifact; no GPU).

- **Endpoint:** `--endpoint fine_label` in `run_nlm002_vision.py` (true test fine label), no fine-label head is trained.
- **Hypothesis:** substitution-transport is better captured by profile continuity than Fisher geometry; paired effect target is `Delta_{F-R} <= -0.05` (R wins by at least 5pp).
- **Construction (unchanged):** exact-Fisher `F` from `PB_coarse`, `PB_rgb_mean`, `PB_luma`, `PB_edge`; `R` from profile agreement on the same probes.
- **Common-support rule:** score only on
  \(S_U = \{(i,j): \forall c\in U, E_c(i,j)=1\}\) (both anchors and both directions defined); abort directional claim if support is empty.
- **Competitors:** `cosine` and `euclid` remain fixed baselines.
- **Gate:** require paired `Delta_{F-R}` and bootstrap CI excluding zero with one-sided lower bound `< -0.05`; kill if `|\Delta|<0.02`, if paired endpoint sensitivity `>0.02` in M2, or if support collapses.
- **Inference:** anchor bootstrap (1000 resamples) over mean pairwise score differences.
- **Decision output:** report `(Delta_F_minus_R, CI95, n_pairs, Q)` first, then pass/fail.

## Round 8 — NLM-003 adjudication: chart wins; R correction

The original lock appeared to pass because `R` reached 0.7343 mean anchor
accuracy against `F` at 0.6303, with `Delta_{F-R} = -0.1040` and 95% CI
`[-0.1478, -0.0584]`. The required sensitivity rerun changes the primitive
interpretation: with `PB_coarse` removed, `R` reaches only 0.5860 while `F`
reaches 0.6668, with `Delta_{F-R} = -0.0950` and 95% CI
`[-0.1422, -0.0490]`. The apparent `R` win was a taxonomy leak: fine labels
nest inside the coarse classes carried by the original profile.

Therefore the original `R`-over-`F` directional claim is **withdrawn**. Round
8 retains only the narrower chart-vs-native comparison: cosine (0.9341 in the
diagnostic artifact; 0.9464 in the original table) and Euclidean distance
outperform both leak-free native candidates on the same 129 supported anchors.
The result is still conditional on thin support and does not establish native
geometry. The correct classification is: **NLM-003 is a corrected narrow
instrument comparison; `R` without the coarse head does not beat `F`, and no
tested native candidate earns replacement status.**

Under the guiding question, this means that in this measured world a denizen can
currently navigate fine-label consequences most accurately by reading ordinary
distances in DINOv2's chart. Is that already the native geometry because the
encoder was trained to make it so? **No, not in the strong sense.** The weak
operational reading is that DINOv2's
pretraining has made chart proximity carry visual regularities that happen to
align with fine-label preservation; it is not evidence that the chart is an
intrinsic native geometry, and DINOv2 was not trained on these CIFAR fine labels.
A world in which this fails would preserve the same latent states while a
declared nonlinear re-chart, a domain shift, or a composed/unseen move changes
cosine and Euclidean rankings and destroys their consequence prediction, while
a transport- or profile-based map continues to predict the held-out outcome.
That is the distinction between a chart that is useful in this world and a map
that belongs to the world.

### Next measurement

This next measurement was superseded by the Round 10 closure below. The frozen
encoder line must not spend another round on arbitrary chart reparameterizations
or transports already included in the encoder's trained invariance class.

### Tier-3 audit #2 corrections (2026-08-27, fresh unprimed auditor; adopted verbatim)

- NLM-003 is a **narrow instrument comparison**: "these implementations lose to
  cosine on this endpoint." It is not evidence that native geometry is
  generally dominated (one encoder, one endpoint, one-step random
  substitutions, one seed, 130 supported anchors).
- R has only five possible values (0–4 agreeing heads) and ties receive 0.5
  credit; tie counts and a tie/outcome cross-tab are not reported and must be.
  R includes the coarse head, and fine labels are nested inside coarse classes,
  so R carries taxonomy-derived signal; rerun R without the coarse head.
- NLM-002 M1: the 2% coarse-head flicker is weak evidence (affine argmax is
  near-monotone by construction); kNN flicker is reported at k = 32 only — a k
  sensitivity analysis is required before any world-path claim.
- Next gate must combine: R without the coarse head, full tie accounting, kNN
  sensitivity, the random-init null (NLM-004, preregistered in the ledger),
  a cheap-baseline ladder under the same endpoint (random-init features,
  PCA/color/edge features, nearest-centroid), nonlinear re-charting, and
  composed / out-of-distribution moves. The program continues only if it finds
  a held-out consequence that simple chart metrics cannot explain.

## NLM-004 — random-init null-world adjudication (Round 9)

**Status:** **SUPPORTED AS EXPLORATORY NULL-WORLD EVIDENCE** against the
registered point-estimate thresholds; no claim of native geometry. The ledger
preregistration was written before scoring and is not downgraded merely because
Claude wrote it. However, `analysis.json` does not contain the preregistered
anchor-bootstrap CIs for the trained-versus-null cosine and embedding-kNN
comparisons, so the stronger confirmatory CI clause is not auditable here.

The lock's registered predictions are met on the reported estimates:

- cosine fine-label consequence accuracy is `0.575` in the random-init chart
  versus `0.946` in the trained chart, a trained-minus-null gap of `0.371`
  (registered thresholds: null `<=0.70`, gap `>=0.20`);
- embedding-kNN fine-label accuracy is `0.069` in the null versus `0.761` in
  the trained chart (registered null threshold: `<=0.25`);
- the null does not make the native candidates competitive: `F=0.581`,
  `R=0.568`, and `R` without the coarse head `=0.546`, with `R` ties at
  `0.329` (the tie accounting is now retained as a required diagnostic, not a
  new native result);
- the null chart's pixel-statistic heads remain predictive (`PB_rgb_mean`
  `0.8335`, `PB_luma` `0.8205`, `PB_edge` `0.531`), while its coarse head is
  only `0.2075`. This is the expected cheap-baseline confound: a random net can
  carry simple image statistics without carrying the trained semantic map.

The M1 null is the sharper separation. Same-class fine-kNN chart-path flicker
is `0.953` in the null (`k=32`; `0.977` at `k=8`, `0.867` at `k=128`) versus
`0.127` in the trained artifact. Null cross-class fine-kNN flicker is `0.987`,
so the null has no useful same-class world-path separation; the pixel-statistic
heads' accuracy is not evidence that it has one.

Under the guiding question, training has done two related but distinct things:
it made chart nearness predict fine-label consequences, and it made straight
segments in that chart stay on coherent fine-label paths. A denizen of the
trained world can therefore use the chart both as a local map and as a usable
first approximation to a path. The null says this is not a generic property of
random coordinates or pixel-statistic readouts. It still does **not** show that
chart straightness is an intrinsic law: the path is defined by imported vector
interpolation, and the readout is itself tied to the trained representation.
Composition and transport are required to distinguish a learned, useful chart
from a chart-independent native geometry.

The adjudication therefore supports: **training inherits a semantic chart and
chart-straight path regularity from the encoder.** It does not support:
"cosine is native," "cosine is merely arbitrary," or any general claim beyond
this encoder, endpoint, and one random-init seed. Artifact:
`experiments/results/nlm004_v1/analysis.json`; preregistration:
ledger id `nlm004_prereg_null_world`.

## NLM-005 — composed transport/substitution gate (LOCK)

**Status:** LOCKED as the next gate. CPU-only; no experiment is run by this
lock. The `nlm003_v2_diagnostics` rerun is a **sensitivity rerun of NLM-003,
not new evidence** and cannot change the Round 8 verdict by itself.

### Hypothesis

Training can make one-step chart nearness and chart-straight paths coherent
without making vector-chart composition a native law. On a held-out composed
move, substitution and transport will expose order dependence that a simple
chart metric cannot explain, while `R` without the coarse head or `F` will be
more stable. If the chart survives both orders with its current margin, the
native-map hypothesis is killed for this world and the result is an
operationally native chart only.

### World, moves, and endpoint

- Keep the NLM-003 DINOv2 cache, true fine-label endpoint, held-out test pool,
  400-anchor/40-candidate layout, and common-support accounting. No
  fine-label head is trained.
- Substitution is the existing move `S_y(x)=y`: replace anchor image `x` by
  candidate image `y`. Its consequence is the inherited true fine-label
  relation `fine(y)=fine(x)`, scored by paired candidate ranking.
- Transport is concrete image-world transport, not a latent proxy. For each
  test image `I`, apply two fixed, label-preserving edits selected before
  scoring: horizontal reflection and a one-pixel right translation with
  declared padding. Re-encode each edited image with the same frozen DINOv2
  encoder on CPU, `T_e(x)=E(e(I_x))`. The original image and edit parameters
  are retained so the operation is reproducible and its inherited label is
  explicit.
- For each `(x,y,e)`, evaluate both order-conditioned composed pairs:
  `ST: x -> S_y(x) -> T_e(y)` and `TS: x -> T_e(x) -> S_y`, where the final
  `S_y` deliberately uses the unedited candidate `y`. Thus the two paths are
  not assumed to commute: the scored pairs are `(x,T_e(y))` and `(T_e(x),y)`
  against the same fine-label-preservation outcome. Direct unedited
  substitution and direct transport are controls.
- Score cosine, Euclidean, `F`, and `R` without `PB_coarse`; retain raw-pixel,
  PCA/color/edge, and random-init chart baselines where available. Report
  anchor-bootstrap CIs, support, pair counts, and all ties.

### Exact predictions and decision rule

- **Primary composition prediction:** on at least one of the two edit families,
  the trained chart's ST-versus-TS ranking changes by at least `0.05` in
  paired mean accuracy, while the direct unedited control does not; and the
  best native candidate (`F` or `R` without coarse) leads the best simple chart
  metric by at least `0.05` with a paired bootstrap lower bound above zero on
  that order-sensitive family.
- **Chart-survival alternative:** if cosine/Euclidean lead the best native
  candidate by at least `0.05` on both ST and TS, with at least `80%` anchor
  support, NLM-005 kills the native-rescue hypothesis and records the chart as
  operationally native for this measured world.
- **Non-diagnostic outcome:** an ST-versus-TS gap below `0.02`, support below
  `80%`, or a missing/unstable endpoint makes the composition result void; it
  cannot be narrated as either native success or chart success.

### Required sensitivity accounting

Rerun the original NLM-003 table with `R` formed from only
`PB_rgb_mean`, `PB_luma`, and `PB_edge`; report exact tie counts, total
comparisons, tie fraction, and a tie-by-outcome cross-tab. Report nonlinear
kNN-fine M1 flicker at `k in {8,32,128}` for same- and cross-class paths.
These are diagnostics of NLM-003 stability, not fresh evidence. If the
headline direction or any relevant score moves by more than `0.02` across the
registered k values, or if ties are not fully accounted for, no native claim
may be promoted.

### Kill conditions

1. Cosine/Euclidean retain a `>=0.05` lead over both native candidates on both
   composed orders with `>=80%` support: kill the native-rescue hypothesis.
2. ST and TS are within `0.02` for every metric: kill the order-sensitive
   composition claim as non-diagnostic.
3. Support falls below `80%`, the endpoint is not independent, or either edit
   is not applied and re-encoded exactly as locked: void the gate.
4. kNN sensitivity changes the NLM-003 directional interpretation by `>0.02`
   or tie accounting is incomplete: retain the Round 8 narrow verdict but
   block any stronger continuation claim.

### CPU cost

Re-encoding the 2,000 held-out test images for each of two edits at the
observed CPU rate of approximately `35 ms/image` is about `140 seconds` of
encoder time, plus at most ten minutes for feature, ranking, bootstrap, and
diagnostic scoring. The full lock is budgeted at `15 CPU-minutes`, one process,
with no GPU. The cached NLM-003 sensitivity rerun is separately budgeted at
`5 CPU-minutes` and does not count as new evidence.

### NLM-005 artifact lock (Claude, 2026-08-27, before scoring)

- Transports: `experiments/results/vision_cifar100_dinov2s/edits.npz`, sha256
  `c6d7cd251d716124ada1c1bc2950c84977db61ff9dbdc1272aa930e42a513b13` — test
  split (2000) under `hflip` (horizontal reflection) and `shift1px` (one-pixel
  right translation, edge-replicate padding), re-encoded by the frozen
  DINOv2-small encoder (revision ed25f3a3…) with the same preprocessing.
- Runner: `experiments/run_nlm002_vision.py --edits <edits.npz> --endpoint
  fine_label` (measurement 4). Predictors: cosine, Euclidean, F (Fisher
  pullback, 4 heads), R without `PB_coarse`. 400 anchors × 40 candidates;
  anchor bootstrap (1000).

## Round 10 — close the frozen-chart line; move outside invariance

### NLM-005 adjudication

**Status: VOID AND NON-DIAGNOSTIC.** NLM-005 scored only 129/400 anchors
(`32.25%`), below the locked `80%` common-support requirement. This alone
triggers kill condition 3 and prevents either a native-rescue or chart-success
claim from the gate. On `hflip`, every ST−TS gap is at most `0.0064`; on
`shift1px`, the chart metrics' gaps are at most `0.0036`, while
`R_no_coarse` is `0.0271`. Thus the shorthand claim that every metric has a
gap no larger than `0.006` is not literally true for that one sensitivity row,
but the support failure makes the result void regardless. There is no robust
order-sensitive composition signal.

Cosine remains ahead of the best native candidate on every scored ST/TS order:
the native-minus-chart differences range from about `-0.314` to `-0.326` for
`hflip` and `-0.323` to `-0.325` for `shift1px`. This is descriptive evidence
on a thin, improperly supported sample, not a confirmation of chart survival
under general transport. The edits were hflip and one-pixel translation, both
augmentations the encoder was trained to make approximately invariant to; they
were near-identity moves in this learned world. The 40-random-candidate design
over 100 classes also made an 80% support target structurally implausible.

### Program closure and residue

Close the **frozen-encoder closeness/map competition** as a program. This does
not promote cosine to intrinsic geometry and does not say that every transport
preserves the chart. It records the five-measurement residue:

1. in a trained world, chart nearness is the best measured one-step map for the
   tested consequence;
2. chart-straight paths are coherent under the trained readouts;
3. the corresponding map and paths collapse in a random-init chart;
4. the tested native candidates do not compete after the coarse-taxonomy leak
   is removed; and
5. the only tested transports were trained-invariant near-identity edits, so
   NLM-005 cannot extend the conclusion beyond that class.

The honest guiding-question answer is therefore: a denizen inherits a useful
chart and some chart-path regularities from training. Those are navigation
equipment supplied by the world's history, not yet laws native to the latent
world. Further frozen-encoder score-chasing on the same class of moves is
closed; the transferable residue is the requirement to identify the world's
admissible moves before calling a chart metric native.

### NLM-006 design: stratified transports outside the invariance class

The replacement line is a transport audit using four predeclared edit families:
large crops, color inversion, image mixing, and occlusion. Each edit must be
specified before scoring and must be verified to produce a non-near-identity
embedding displacement on calibration images. Use held-out image identities,
the true fine-label outcome, and a stratified candidate pool: 20 same-fine-class
candidates plus 20 cross-class hard negatives per anchor, with the strata and
candidate identities frozen before metric scoring. Report each stratum
separately; stratification makes support achievable but is not itself evidence
for a semantic claim.

**Hypothesis.** If chart nearness is inherited navigation equipment rather than
a law of the world, at least one transport family outside the trained
invariance class will break its held-out consequence ranking or expose a
transport-aware native predictor that remains stable when cosine/Euclidean do
not. If all genuinely displaced families preserve the chart lead, the useful
chart may be the world's operational map for this tested move envelope.

**Decisive result.** Support the replacement hypothesis if at least two of four
edit families, at `>=80%` anchor support, show either (a) a transport-aware
native predictor leading the best chart metric by `>=0.05` with a paired
anchor-bootstrap lower bound above zero, or (b) the chart lead collapsing to
`<=0.02` on a predeclared composition/order test while the direct control stays
stable. A chart lead of `>=0.05` on all four families, with measured
non-near-identity displacement and the same support, closes this replacement
too and leaves the chart as the operational map for that measured envelope.

**Kill conditions.** Kill the outside-invariance hypothesis if the chart retains
the preregistered lead on every valid family. Void the run if any edit remains
inside the encoder's measured invariance class, if candidate selection changes
after scoring, if support falls below `80%` despite stratification, or if the
endpoint is not held out from metric construction. A single successful edit is
not enough to overturn the five-measurement residue.

**CPU cost.** Four edits over the 2,000-image held-out split are approximately
`280 seconds` of re-encoding at the observed `35 ms/image`, plus at most ten
minutes for stratified ranking, composition, and anchor-bootstrap scoring: a
roughly 15-minute CPU run, one process, no GPU.
