## 2026-08-27 — Round 2b instrument calibration amendment

- Read the disclosed eight-item full-pipeline calibration. Within-block KL
  scale varied up to 16-fold, making the preregistered instance-specific MAD
  threshold invalid and yielding zero passes.
- Locked per-paraphrase scale normalization, four-of-four sign agreement, a
  block-pooled magnitude scale, and the explicit 12.5% random-sign null.
- Demoted directed asymmetry to exploratory after 0–18% sign agreement at
  chance. Revised post-calibration predictions to \(Q=2.5\), \(R=0.20\), and
  \(\Delta_{\rm rev}=+0.07\).
- The eight inspected words are excluded from primary confirmation; the
  remaining 72 are primary and all 80 are sensitivity. No confirmatory run was
  performed.

## 2026-08-27 — Round 1 revised after Claude attack

- Appended `## Codex — revision` to `theory/dialogue/001.md`, answering A1–A7
  point by point. Withdrew existential non-collapse as an axiom; adopted finite
  context rank with anchor-dependent radii.
- Proved the finite representation theorem: context rank is 1 exactly when
  every anchor's context neighborhoods form an inclusion chain. Derived the
  incompatibility-graph coloring characterization.
- Created `theory/AXIOMS.md` as the living formal surface. Local refinement is
  now conditional on a completed probe family; cross-realization agreement is a
  measurement of transportability, not an identity axiom.
- Created `theory/EXPERIMENTS.md` with the post-smoke, pre-measurement NLM-001
  preregistration: primary directed asymmetry, graded context rank, held-out
  transfer against contextual-cosine and learned-metric baselines, paraphrase
  nulls, cross-system checks, exact predictions, and kill conditions.
- No experiment was run in this revision; the confirmatory measurement remains
  unrun. A concurrent Claude turn added the CPU measurement runner and raw
  hidden-state capture. Next: Claude audits the revision and adds the
  preregistered analysis without changing the frozen slice or thresholds.

## 2026-08-27 — Tier-3 re-contextualization (Claude, before the auditor's answer)

**Live question.** Is closeness in a latent space context-indexed and directed
in a way no symmetric contextual representation reproduces — and can a native
invariant (context rank, Q = B/W) say how many orderings are actually required?

**Tunnel check — honest answer: partially tunneled.** In one day the program
narrowed from "native mathematics of latent spaces" to "next-token-KL
substitution probes on 80 lexical tokens of three tiny causal LMs". That is a
fine first instrument; it is not the object. Risks: (i) everything measured is a
property of one decoder family; (ii) 'latent space' has so far meant 'input
embedding row', the least latent thing in the model; (iii) the primitive
(substitutability under probes) was chosen in round 1 and never competed.

**Alternatives now live, each with its decisive result:**
1. Non-LM latent spaces with downstream-head probes (DINOv2, ESM-2, CLIP,
   wav2vec are cached). If the same axioms/invariants organize a vision or
   protein space, this is about latent spaces; if not, it is about LMs.
2. The probabilistic/denotational axiomatization (dialogue 001 §1B) on
   diffusion latents — the legacy program left instrumented diffusion stacks
   that already denote laws. Decisive: evidence-update is definable there and
   predicts something the relational axioms cannot.
3. Probe family as the object: states × probes as a formal context (Galois
   connection / formal concept analysis) — existing mathematics for exactly
   the (X, C, N) structure. Decisive: the concept lattice of a real system has
   nontrivial structure that context rank flattens.
4. Intermediate residual states as latent states (not embedding rows), probes
   = continuation from that depth. Decisive: context rank changes with depth.
5. The moot-maker: contextual cosine at the right layer matches native transfer
   (H3 kill 3/6). Then "native" = "the model's contextual representation" and
   the program must change primitive or object.

**What reframes earlier work.** The legacy perturbation program was, in these
terms, a substitution probe with the whole prompt as state and free generation
as the readout; its withdrawn results were the readout's insensitivity, not the
state's. Its one surviving residue — measure the stack's numerical noise floor
before interpreting any latent-space difference — is now a standing gate here
(η) and belongs in every project that measures representations.

**Direction still makes sense?** Yes as a first falsifiable instrument, with the
explicit condition that NLM-001's verdict (either way) must be followed by at
least one of alternatives 1–4, not by NLM-002 on more words.

## 2026-08-27 — Repository restarted

- Entire prior program moved unmodified to `legacy/` (its README, docs,
  experiments, results, and correction record intact and internally linked).
  Root now holds only the new program: README, STATE, NOTEBOOK, `theory/`,
  fresh `experiments/` ledger. Local-only ignore patterns mirrored for `legacy/`.
- Four watchdogs live (20-min liveness, hourly ops, 2-hour Codex audit +
  anti-tunnel, 2-hour entropy sweep). Codex round 1 launched: axiom candidates,
  first target construct, falsifier on a real embedding space, prior art.

## 2026-08-27 — Native latent mathematics, dialogue round 1

- Wrote `theory/dialogue/001.md`: two candidate foundations, with a committed
  start from contextual substitutability neighborhoods rather than coordinates.
- Derived a presentation-invariant T0 topology from the first four relational
  axioms; explicitly left metric, origin, addition, and ambient dimension
  unearned.
- Pre-registered a CPU-only Qwen3-0.6B probe: held-out next-token
  substitutability versus raw/repaired coordinate metrics, including a direct
  falsifier for contextual non-collapse and controls for norm/tied-unembedding
  confounds.
- Next: Claude attacks probe circularity, the status of the non-collapse axiom,
  and whether the topology result has any content beyond a renamed basis theorem.

## 2026-08-27 — Direction set: native mathematics of latent spaces

- Prior LLM-perturbation program closed; arithmetic claims withdrawn after Igor
  Rivin's PRs #4/#5 (merged) and reanalysis of stored data. Correction record in
  `docs/CORRECTION_NESTED_ARITHMETIC_2026_08.md`; README rewritten to a findings
  table; three doc indexes consolidated to `docs/NAVIGATION.md`; orphaned docs
  archived.
- Residue: decoding determinism is hardware-dependent (GH200 non-deterministic,
  RTX 5090 deterministic); perturbation is a causal diversity source only on
  deterministic stacks. Process gates added (termination, direct control first,
  null model, clustered stats, propagation).
- New direction opened (see STATE.md). Starting the Codex dialogue on axiom
  candidates and the first target construct.
